      \field{abstract}{A deterministic model of density-regulated selection with genotypic interactions is developed for a diploid population with discrete, nonoverlapping generations. The population is polymorphic for two alleles at an autosomal locus. Before selection in each generation, the three genotypes are in Hardy-Weinberg frequencies, but genotypes differ in their selective values because of genotypic differences in their intrinsic rates of increase, carrying capacities, and genotypic interactions. The genotypic interactions specify the effect of an individual of one genotype on the fitness of another genotype. By analogy to the Lotka-Volterra model for interspecific competition, our model for intraspecific competition assumes that the selective value of a genotype strictly decreases with numbers of each genotype; therefore, selective values depend on both density and gene frequency. Sufficient conditions for a protected polymorphism are surprisingly simple: the heterozygote must have a carrying capacity greater than that of either homozygote multiplied by the interaction coefficient which expresses the effect of that homozygote on the heterozygote; or, alternatively each homozygous individual must inhibit the fitness of its own genotype, and hence its contribution to population growth, more than it inhibits the fitness of the heterozygote.}

      \field{abstract}{I chose to work on the genetic architecture of fitness-related traits in populations of three species of Drosophila subjected to selection for adaptation to larval crowding, with the primary focus being on the following questions: 1. Is the network of genetic correlations among fitness-related traits under larval crowding similar in species of Drosophila other than D. melanogaster and, if not, does it vary with evolutionary distance? 2. Do D. ananassae populations selected for adaptation to larval crowding exhibit a polymorphism of different genotypes for exploiting temporal variation in the environment, as seen earlier in D. melanogaster? 3. Can maintenance regime have an effect on the genetic architecture of fitness-related traits through promoting assortative mating for development time under crowding? The first question is general and pertains to the degree to which the genetic architecture of fitness-related traits is conserved across congeners, whereas the other two questions arise from differences between my results and those obtained in earlier selection studies on adaptation to crowding in D. melanogaster. I chose to work on adaptation to crowding because previous studies in D. melanogaster involving selection for either adaptation to crowding or faster development, unlike studies where age at reproduction or stress tolerance was selected for, revealed a fairly consistent pattern of genetic correlations among traits like development time, pre-adult viability, larval feeding rate, larval competitive ability and weight at eclosion. Thus, adaptation to crowding seemed to be a good selection pressure 13 under which to examine the generality of the genetic architecture of these traits in other Drosophila species. I worked on three species of Drosophila —{} D. ananassae, D. nasuta and D. melanogaster. D. ananassae and D. melanogaster are closer evolutionarily as compared to D. nasuta, belong to the same sub-genus Sophophora and the Melanogaster species group, and diverged 12 MYA. D. nasuta belongs to a different sub-genus, Drosophila, and diverged from D. melanogaster ca. 50 MYA. Hence, to answer the first question, I inferred the signs of genetic correlations among fitness-related traits in these three species by examining correlated responses to selection for adaptation to larval crowding. In D. melanogaster, an earlier selection studies on six populations, three of which were selected for adaptation to low density (r-populations) and three for adaptation to high density (K-populations), revealed a trade-off in net productivity at the two densities. K-populations had higher net productivity at high densities and r-populations had higher net productivity at low density. K-populations also showed evolution of higher competitive ability and larval feeding rate as compared to the r-populations, with no change in development time and weight at eclosion, when assayed at moderate densities. A further study in D. melanogaster, with selection for crowding only at the larval stage, also showed evolution of almost similar life-history and related traits. The populations selected for adaptation to larval crowding showed evolution of higher larval feeding rate, competitive ability, and tolerance to urea and ammonia, as compared to the controls. In these lines also, there was no change in development time and weight at eclosion at moderate densities, even though lipid content at eclosion was higher at high density. In both studies, efficiency of food utilization was lower in the selected populations. Thus, the two studies of density- 14 dependent selection in D. melanogaster showed evolution of similar set of traits, and this pattern was also seen in populations of D. melanogaster selected for rapid egg to adult development. In my experiments, selection for larval crowding in D. ananassae showed evolution of traits which were different from the ones obtained in the earlier studies in D. melanogaster. The selected populations showed higher pre-adult survivorship and competitive ability at high density. The development time of selected populations decreased, whereas there was no change in dry weight and lipid content at eclosion, when assayed at either low and high densities. Moreover, there was no change in larval feeding rate, unlike in previous studies on D. melanogaster, where feeding rate was positively correlated with competitive ability. Moreover, D. ananassae populations selected for adaptation to larval crowding were found to be more efficient than the controls. The minimum feeding time (the minimum amount of time the larva needs to feed to reach the critical size necessary for pupation and eclosion) decreased in the selected populations and the feeding rate did not change. Thus, the flies were taking in less amount of food but were reaching the critical size early. The adult traits —{} life span, fecundity and starvation resistance —{} followed a trend similar to that seen in the earlier studies on D. melanogaster. There was no change in life span and fecundity in the selected populations, whereas starvation resistance was higher in flies raised at higher density in the selected populations as compared to controls. Overall, in D. ananassae, the network of genetic correlations among traits related to fitness under larval crowding was quite different from that seen in D. melanogaster in earlier studies. 15 Interestingly, selection for adaptation to larval crowding in my D. nasuta and D. melanogaster populations also showed the evolution of a suite of traits very similar to D. ananassae: selected populations evolved higher competitive ability, decreased development time and no change in larval feeding rate and weight at eclosion. Adult traits also showed similar results across all three species. Thus, even the D. melanogaster populations in my study showed a different pattern of genetic correlations than that seen in previous studies. Compared to the D. ananassae and D. nasuta populations that were relatively recently wild-caught, my D. melanogaster populations were derived from very long-term laboratory populations. The observation of a similar pattern of correlated responses to selection in all three species, therefore, suggests that differences in the duration of laboratory adaptation are not likely to be the cause for the observed differences between the traits that evolved in previous studies on D. melanogaster and in my D. ananassae and D. nasuta populations. A further possibility is that these differences in traits evolved in response to selection for adaptation to larval crowding could be due to a small difference in maintenance regime between my study and a previous study on D. melanogaster. I discuss this possibility at the end, because my next experiment further suggested that maintenance regime could have played a role in mediating the evolution of a different set of traits in my study. An earlier study in D. melanogaster had revealed the existence of a polymorphism in the crowding adapted populations. Early emerging genotypes from a crowded culture showed higher larval feeding rate but lower tolerance to nitrogenous wastes than late emerging genotypes. I also wanted to check if the D. ananassae populations selected for adaptation to larval crowding showed such a polymorphism. However, I found no evidence for such a polymorphism in the selected populations of D. ananassae, with the progeny of early and 16 late emerging flies in a crowded culture exhibiting almost similar larval feeding rate, development time and tolerance to nitrogenous wastes. One difference in the maintenance regime I used and that used in the previous study on D. melanogaster that revealed this polymorphism was in the collection of adult flies from the crowded larval vials. In my experiments, emerging flies from the larval vials were collected into a cage daily, implying that flies emerging on a particular day got pooled into the same cage with all the flies that had emerged on previous days. In the previous study on D. melanogaster, however, flies eclosing on a particular day were housed with others eclosing the same day for several days prior to being pooled into a cage. The latter regime, in principle, could have inadvertently induced assortative mating for development time in the crowding-adapted populations and this, in turn, could have driven the maintenance of the earlier discussed polymorphism. I examined this possibility further by doing a one-generation experiment, using D. melanogaster scarlet eye and red eye flies, in which I replicated the two maintenance regimes and then studied the mating system in both. In the set up replicating the earlier type of maintenance regime, I found proportionately more assortative mating for development time happening, as compared to the set up similar to my maintenance regime. This finding strengthens the view that the polymorphism seen in the earlier study might have been due to maintenance regime induced assortative mating among the early and late emerging flies. In principle, it is possible for differences in mating system to affect the pattern of genetic correlations and thus, explain the differences between my study and previous studies. However, the present data do not permit unequivocal conclusions to be drawn. It could also be the case that quantitative differences in the degree of crowding affect the fitness-weighting of different traits, thereby leading to varied patterns of correlated responses to 17 selection for adaptation to crowding in the different studies. Further experimental work will be required to probe this possibility. Overall, my study shows that the different congeneric species under similar selection pressures can show a fairly similar genetic architecture of fitness-related traits, even though evolutionarily they might be far apart. Although some pair-wise correlations were species-specific, the major correlations among traits relevant to fitness under crowding were quite similar across the three species I studied. My results also exemplify how seemingly trivial aspects of maintenance regime can have important evolutionary consequences, possibly even affecting the network of genetic correlations revealed under different selection pressures.}

      \field{abstract}{A diploid model is introduced and analyzed in which intraspecific competition is incorporated within the context of density-regulated selection. It is assumed that each genotype has a unique carrying capacity corresponding to the equilibrium population size when only that type is present. Each genotypic fitness at a single diallelic autosomal locus is a decreasing function of a distinctive effective population size perceived as a result of intraspecific competition. The resulting fitnesses are both density and frequency dependent with selective advantage determined by a balance between genotypic carrying capacity and sensitivity to intraspecific competition. A major finding is that intergenotypic interactions may allow genetic variation to be more easily maintained than in the corresponding model of purely density-dependent selection. In addition, numerical study confirms the possible existence of multiple interior equilibria and that neither overdominance in fitness nor carrying capacity is necessary for stability. The magnitude of the equilibrium population size and optimization principles are also discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{Populations of Drosophila melanogaster subjected to extreme larval (CU) or adult (UC) densities for multiple generations were assayed for a variety of life history characters. When reared under either crowded or uncrowded larval conditions, populations which had been selected to tolerate the limitation of resources imposed by extreme larval (CU) crowding, exhibited greater starvation resistance and lipid content than did populations which do not routinely undergo larval density-dependent regulation. Previous studies have shown that the CU populations do not show a correlated increase in longevity; as has been generally observed for these characteristics in age-structured populations of D. melanogaster. This suggests that density-dependent natural selection may not always shape life histories of the same characteristic in the same direction that age-specific selection does.}

      \field{abstract}{Environments that are crowded with larvae of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, exhibit a temporal deterioration in quality as waste products accumulate and food is depleted. We show that natural selection in these environments can maintain a genetic polymorphism with one group of genotypes specializing on the early part of the environment and a second group specializing on the late part. These specializations involve trade-offs in fitness components. The early types emerge first from crowded cultures and have high larval feeding rates, which are positively correlated with competitive ability but exhibit lower absolute viability than the late phenotype, especially in food contaminated with the nitrogenous waste product, ammonia. The late emerging types have reduced feeding rates but higher absolute survival under conditions of severe crowding and high levels of ammonia. Organisms that experience temporal variation within a single generation are not uncommon, and this model system provides some of the first insights into the evolutionary forces at work in these environments.}

      \field{abstract}{Growth relations of lines selected for fast or slow larval feeding rate have been compared with those in the genetically heterogeneous control base population from which they were derived. Larvae of the slow strain have reduced growth rate and reach their critical weight for pupation later than unselected larvae. Larvae of the fast strain attain their critical weight at the same time as the unselected control larvae, suggesting that growth rate in the precritical period of development is already maximized in the base population and cannot be improved by increasing food intake. This constraint does not apply to the fixed period of post-critical growth however, since fast feeding larvae give rise to larger adult flies than the controls.Larval feeding rate is affected by genes located on all three major chromosomes. The small fourth chromosome has negligible effect. Selection for slow feeding rate has led to an increase in the frequency of recessive genes affecting the character. High scores of larvae selected for fast feeding rate depend upon interactions between non-homologous selected chromosomes which individually have little effect. Larval feeding rate in the control unselected population appears to be buffered, firstly by epistatic interactions against the effects of chromosomes tending to promote `supra-optimal' feeding rate and, secondly, by dominance against chromosomes promoting a lowering of feeding rate.Under conditions of scramble type competition between the selected lines for limited resources, fast feeding larvae have a higher survival rate, and complete their period of larval development earlier to give larger adult flies than their slow feeding competitors. The contribution of larval feeding rate to competitive ability at different levels is discussed, and it is suggested that the effects of change in this behavioural character may be far reaching.}

      \field{abstract}{An Illustrated Guide to Theoretical Ecology uses a combination of visual presentations and the symbolic logic of algebra and calculus to provide the most accessible introduction to ecological theory available. It gives students the basic tools they need to understand the complexities of ecological systems and to analyze simple quantitative ecological problems. The author walks students through the most common models in ecology, beginning with first principles and then gently making each formulation accessible through a step-by-step development of equations paired with lavish illustrations. He also applies theoretical developments to practical issues in conservation and resource management, offering a more visceral understanding of the purpose and utility of the theory and demonstrating how it may need modification in its application to real-world problems and future directions. The text also includes some basic ecological genetics and an exploration of metapopulation dynamics. An Illustrated Guide to Theoretical Ecology is enhanced by over 500 two-color diagrams, many end-of-chapter problems, and a website that includes simulation models that parallel each chapters development (http: //www.nceas.ucsb.edu/BookCase). Ideal as a main text for advanced undergraduate courses in theoretical and mathematical ecology or conservation biology, this unique book can also serve as a supplement or a self-guided tutorial in general ecology, population ecology, and community ecology courses.}

      \field{abstract}{Density-dependent selection is expected to lead to population stability, especially if r and K tradeoff. Yet, there is no empirical evidence of adaptation to crowding leading to the evolution of stability. We show that populations of Drosophila ananassae selected for adaptation to larval crowding have higher K and lower r, and evolve greater stability than controls. We also show that increased population growth rates at high density can enhance stability, even in the absence of a decrease in r, by ensuring that the crowding adapted populations do not fall to very low sizes. We discuss our results in the context of traits known to have diverged between the selected and control populations, and compare our results with previous work on the evolution of stability in D. melanogaster. Overall, our results suggest that density-dependent selection may be an important factor promoting the evolution of relatively stable dynamics in natural populations.}

      \field{abstract}{The digging behavior of larvae from the following strains ofDrosophila melanogaster was studied: Oregon R-c, taxi, yellow, and vestigial. It was found that the time of stay of preadults in the culture medium, the number of larvae, and the illumination conditions can modify this behavior. The presence of this characteristic depends on the genetic composition of the population: the larvae of each strain used exhibited their own particular pattern of dispersal throughout the culture medium, independent of the experimental conditions under which this behavior was surveyed.}

      \field{abstract}{The genetic control of larval tolerance to urea, a nitrogenous waste-product occurring naturally in crowded Drosophila cultures, was investigated in a set of five laboratory populations of D. melanogaster that had been successfully subjected to selection for increased larval urea tolerance. Larva to adult survivorship and development time at three different levels of urea were assayed on the five selected populations, their five matched controls and a set of 10 F1 hybrid populations derived from reciprocal crosses between pairs of selected and control populations. As expected from the results of previous studies, the selected populations exhibited greater larval tolerance to the toxic effects of urea, relative to their controls. Comparison of the hybrid and parental populations with respect to both survivorship and development time indicated that the genetic control of urea tolerance in the selected populations is largely dominant, and has a significant X-linked component. The data also suggested that females from the selected populations exercise a nongenetic maternal effect on the development time of their progeny, regardless of urea level.}

      \field{abstract}{Six populations of Drosophila melanogaster have been kept at extreme population densities, three high and three low, for 175 generations. Larvae from the high density populations pupate 50\%-100\% higher than larvae from the low density populations. At high larval test densities there is both a directional and a stabilizing component to selection, with viabilities ranging from 0.14 to 0.992, depending on the choice of pupation site. The directional component is stronger on the populations which have evolved at low densities, while the stabilizing component is stronger on the populations which have evolved at high densities. There is no indication that the evolution of this trait, in response to density, has altered its phenotypic plasticity.}

      \field{abstract}{Natural selection at high densities has often been postulated to favour the evolution of greater efficiency of food use. Contrary to this expectation, a previous study suggested the existence of a trade-off between larval feeding rate and efficiency at using food to complete larval development in populations ofDrosophila melanogaster subjected to crowding for many generations. In this paper, we confirm the generality of such a density-dependent trade-off between food acquisition and utilization by demonstrating its occurrence in a new set ofDrosophila populations subjected to extreme larval crowding. We suggest that such trade-offs between food acquisition and food use may represent a general phenomenon in organisms exhibiting scramble competition. We test and reject the possible mechanistic explanation that decreased efficiency of food use in faster-feeding larvae may merely be a consequence of a faster passage of food through the gut, leading to incomplete assimilation of nutrients and energy.}

      \field{abstract}{In theDrosophila literature, selection for faster development and selection for adapting to high density are often confounded, leading, for example, to the expectation that selection for faster development should also lead to higher competitive ability. At the same time, results from experimental studies on evolution at high density do not agree with many of the predictions from classical density-dependent selection theory. We put together a number of theoretical and empirical results from the literature, and some new experimental results onDrosophila populations successfully subjected to selection for faster development, to argue for a broader interpretation of density-dependent selection. We show that incorporating notions of {$\alpha$}-selection, and the division of competitive ability into effectiveness and tolerance components, into the concept of density-dependent selection yields a formulation that allows for a better understanding of the empirical results. We also use this broader formulation to predict that selection for faster development inDrosophila should, in fact, lead to the correlated evolution of decreased competitive ability, even though it does lead to the evolution of greater efficiency and higher population growth rates at high density when in monotypic culture.}

      \field{abstract}{Biogeography was stuck in a "natural history phase" dominated by the collection of data, the young Princeton biologists Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson argued in 1967. In this book, the authors developed a general theory to explain the facts of island biogeography. The theory builds on the first principles of population ecology and genetics to explain how distance and area combine to regulate the balance between immigration and extinction in island populations. The authors then test the theory against data. The Theory of Island Biogeography was never intended as the last word on the subject. Instead, MacArthur and Wilson sought to stimulate new forms of theoretical and empirical studies, which will lead in turn to a stronger general theory. Even a third of a century since its publication, the book continues to serve that purpose well. From popular books like David Quammen's Song of the Dodo to arguments in the professional literature, The Theory of Island Biogeography remains at the center of discussions about the geographic distribution of species. In a new preface, Edward O. Wilson reviews the origins and consequences of this classic book.}

      \field{abstract}{Populations ofDrosophila melanogaster kept at high population density (K-selected) for 125 generations have higher larval viability than populations kept at low densities (r-selected) when both are raised under crowded conditions. In additionK-selected adults that emerge from crowded cultures are larger than theirr-selected counterparts. These differences cannot be explained by differences in efficiency of food use. The minimum food required for successful pupation is actually greater in theK-selected populations. I conjecture that there may be a trade-off between minimum food requirements and competitive ability, which has changed substantially in theK-selected populations. The possibility thatK-selected larvae can dig more more deeply and gain access to unused food is examined and rejected as a possible explanation of the viability differences. Evidence is provided supporting the hypothesis that the differences in viability may be due to an increased tendency of theK-selected larvae to pupate off the surface of the medium.}

      \field{abstract}{The development of theory on density-dependent natural selection has seen a transition from very general, logistic growth-based models to theories that incorporate details of specific life histories. This transition has been justified by the need to make predictions that can then be tested experimentally with specific model systems like bacteria or Drosophila. The most general models predict that natural selection should increase density-dependent rates of population growth. When trade-offs exist, those genotypes favored in low-density environments will show reduced per capita growth rates under crowded conditions and vice versa for evolution in crowded environments. This central prediction has been verified twice in carefully controlled experiments with Drosophila. Empirical research in this field has also witnessed a major transition from field-based observations and conjecture to carefully controlled laboratory selection experiments. This change in approach has permitted crucial tests of theories of density-dependent natural selection and a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of adaptation to different levels of population crowding. Experimental research with Drosophila has identified several phenotypes important to adaptation, especially at high larval densities. This same research revealed that an important trade-off occurs between competitive ability and energetic efficiency.}

      \field{abstract}{Density-dependent genetic evolution was tested in experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster subject for eight generations to natural selection under high (K-selection) or low (r-selection) population density regimes. The test consisted of determining at high and at low densities the per capita rate of population growth of the selected populations. At high densities, the K-selected populations showed a higher per capita rate of population growth than did r-selected populations, but the reverse was true at low densities. These results corroborate the predictions derived from formal models of density-dependent selection. However, no evidence of a trade-off in per capita rate of growth was observed in 25 populations of D. melanogaster, each homozygous for a different second chromosome sampled from a natural population.}

      \field{abstract}{Energy allocation is believed to drive trade-offs in life history evolution. We develop a physiological and genetic model of energy allocation that drives evolution of feeding rate in a well-studied model system. In a variety of stressful environments Drosophila larvae adapt by altering their rate of feeding. Drosophila larvae adapted to high levels of ammonia, urea, and the presence of parasitoids evolve lower feeding rates. Larvae adapted to crowded conditions evolve higher feeding rates. Feeding rates should affect gross food intake, metabolic rates, and efficiency of food utilization. We develop a model of larval net energy intake as a function of feeding rates. We show that when there are toxic compounds in the larval food that require energy for detoxification, larvae can maximize their energy intake by slowing their feeding rates. While the reduction in feeding rates may increase development time and decrease competitive ability, we show that genotypes with lower feeding rates can be favored by natural selection if they have a sufficiently elevated viability in the toxic environment. This work shows how a simple phenotype, larval feeding rates, may be of central importance in adaptation to a wide variety of stressful environments via its role in energy allocation.}

      \field{abstract}{The standard view of adaptation to larval crowding in fruitflies, built on results from 25 years of multiple experimental evolution studies on Drosophila melanogaster, was that enhanced competitive ability evolves primarily through increased larval feeding and foraging rate, and increased larval tolerance to nitrogenous wastes, at the cost of efficiency of food conversion to biomass. These results were at odds from the predictions of classical K-selection theory, notably the expectation that selection at high density should result in the increase of efficiency of conversion of food to biomass, and were better interpreted through the lens of {$\alpha$}-selection. We show here that populations of D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta subjected to extreme larval crowding evolve greater competitive ability and pre-adult survivorship at high density, primarily through a combination of reduced larval duration, faster attainment of minimum critical size for pupation, greater time efficiency of food conversion to biomass and increased pupation height, with a relatively small role of increased urea/ammonia tolerance, if at all. This is a very different suite of traits than that seen to evolve under similar selection in D. melanogaster, and seems to be closer to the expectations from the canonical theory of K-selection. We also discuss possible reasons for these differences in results across the three species. Overall, the results reinforce the view that our understanding of the evolution of competitive ability in fruitflies needs to be more nuanced than before, with an appreciation that there may be multiple evolutionary routes through which higher competitive ability can be attained.}

      \field{abstract}{A series of laboratory selection experiments onDrosophila melanogaster over the past two decades has provided insights into the specifics of life-history tradeoffs in the species and greatly refined our understanding of how ecology and genetics interact in life-history evolution. Much of what has been learnt from these studies about the subtlety of the microevolutionary process also has significant implications for experimental design and inference in organismal biology beyond life-history evolution, as well as for studies of evolution in the wild. Here we review work on the ecology and evolution of life-histories in laboratory populations ofD. melanogaster, emphasizing how environmental effects on life-history-related traits can influence evolutionary change. We discuss life-history tradeoffs—{}many unexpected—{}revealed by selection experiments, and also highlight recent work that underscores the importance to life-history evolution of cross-generation and cross-life-stage effects and interactions, sexual antagonism and sexual dimorphism, population dynamics, and the possible role of biological clocks in timing life-history events. Finally, we discuss some of the limitations of typical selection experiments, and how these limitations might be transcended in the future by a combination of more elaborate and realistic selection experiments, developmental evolutionary biology, and the emerging discipline of phenomics.}

      \field{abstract}{Density—{}dependent selective values illustrate the evolutionary effect of population—{}regulating processes that diminish an individual's probability of survival with increased crowding. The selective values, assumed to decrease as a linear function of density, lead in a mild environment to the evolution of phenotypes having a high carrying capacity, K, at the expense of a low intrinsic rate of increase, r. A graphical technique shows that selection causes evolution of phenotypes having a high r at the expense of a low K in harsh seasonal environments. A mathematical technique developed for analyzing evolution in coarse—{}grained seasonal environments reveals genetic mechanisms, including ones with full dominance, with which a moderately harsh seasonal environment causes stable polymorphism between high—{}r and high—{}K genes. The energy balance equation demonstrates the role of high—{}r and high—{}K phenotypes in the population's energy flow. A high—{}r phenotype makes a large expected contribution to the population's productivity under conditions of negligible crowding, and a high—{}K phenotype has, for a given contribution to the population's productivity under uncrowded conditions, a low sensitivity to having that contribution diminished by crowding.}

      \field{abstract}{Drosophila melanogaster populations subjected to extreme larval crowding (CU lines) in our laboratory have evolved higher larval feeding rates than their corresponding controls (UU lines). It has been suggested that this genetically based behavior may involve an energetic cost, which precludes natural selection in a density-regulated population to simultaneously maximize food acquisition and food conversion into biomass. If true, this stands against some basic predictions of the general theory of density-dependent natural selection. Here we investigate the evolutionary consequences of density-dependent natural selection on growth rate and body size in D. melanogaster. The CU populations showed a higher growth rate during the postcritical period of larval life than UU populations, but the sustained differences in weight did not translate into the adult stage. The simplest explanation for these findings (that natural selection in a crowded larval environment favors a faster food acquisition for the individual to attain the same final body size in a shorter period of time) was tested and rejected by looking at the larva-to-adult development times. Larvae of CU populations starved for different periods of time develop into comparatively smaller adults, suggesting that food seeking behavior in a food depleted environment carries a higher cost to these larvae than to their UU counterparts. The results have important implications for understanding the evolution of body size in natural populations of Drosophila, and stand against some widespread beliefs that body size may represent a compromise between the conflicting effects of genetic variation in larval and adult performance.}

      \field{abstract}{Recently single crystals of layered SnSe has created a paramount importance in thermoelectrics owing to their ultralow lattice thermal conductivity and high thermoelectric figure of merit (zT). However, nanocrystalline or polycrystalline SnSe offers a wide range of thermoelectric applications for the ease of its synthesis and machinability. Here, we demonstrate high zT of 2.1 at 873 K in two dimensional (2D) nanoplates of Ge doped SnSe synthesized by a simple hydrothermal route followed by spark plasma sintering (SPS). Anisotropic measurements also show a high zT of \textasciitilde{}1.8 at 873 K parallel to the SPS pressing direction. 3 mol\% Ge-doping in SnSe nanoplates significantly enhances the p-type carrier concentration which results in high electrical conductivity and power factor of \textasciitilde{}5.10 {$\mu$}W/cmK2 at 873 K. In addition to nanoscale grain boundary and high lattice anharmonicity in SnSe nanoplates, phonon scattering due to Ge precipitates in the SnSe matrix gives rise to the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of \textasciitilde{}0.18 W/mK at 873 K.}

      \field{abstract}{Multiple experimental evolution studies on Drosophila melanogaster in the 1980s and 1990s indicated that enhanced competitive ability evolved primarily through increased larval tolerance to nitrogenous wastes and increased larval feeding and foraging rate, at the cost of efficiency of food conversion to biomass, and this became the widely accepted view of how adaptation to larval crowding evolves in fruitflies. We recently showed that populations of D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta subjected to extreme larval crowding evolved greater competitive ability without evolving higher feeding rates, primarily through a combination of reduced larval duration, faster attainment of minimum critical size for pupation, greater efficiency of food conversion to biomass, increased pupation height and, perhaps, greater urea/ammonia tolerance. This was a very different suite of traits than that seen to evolve under similar selection in D. melanogaster and was closer to the expectations from the theory of K-selection. At that time, we suggested two possible reasons for the differences in the phenotypic correlates of greater competitive ability seen in the studies with D. melanogaster and the other two species. First, that D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta had a very different genetic architecture of traits affecting competitive ability compared to the long-term laboratory populations of D. melanogaster used in the earlier studies, either because the populations of the former two species were relatively recently wild-caught, or by virtue of being different species. Second, that the different evolutionary trajectories in D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta versus D. melanogaster were a reflection of differences in the manner in which larval crowding was imposed in the two sets of selection experiments. The D. melanogaster studies used a higher absolute density of eggs per unit volume of food, and a substantially larger total volume of food, than the studies on D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta. Here, we show that long-term laboratory populations of D. melanogaster, descended from some of the populations used in the earlier studies, evolve essentially the same set of traits as the D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta crowding-adapted populations when subjected to a similar larval density at low absolute volumes of food. As in the case of D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta, and in stark contrast to earlier studies with D. melanogaster, these crowding-adapted populations of D. melanogaster did not evolve greater larval feeding rates as a correlate of increased competitive ability. The present results clearly suggest that the suite of phenotypes through which the evolution of greater competitive ability is achieved in fruitflies depends critically not just on larval density per unit volume of food, but also on the total amount of food available in the culture vials. We discuss these results in the context of an hypothesis about how larval density and the height of the food column in culture vials might interact to alter the fitness costs and benefits of increased larval feeding rates, thus resulting in different routes to the evolution of greater competitive ability, depending on the details of exactly how the larval crowding was implemented.}

      \field{abstract}{The relationship between the processes of density-dependent and age-specific selection has been investigated by examining a common phenotype, urea resistance, which has apparently evolved in response to each of these selection mechanisms. Twenty populations that have experienced differing levels of age-specific selection show differences in egg-to-adult viability in environments with high levels of urea. Among this group of populations, it appears that resistance to urea is correlated with longevity, but not development time. Ten populations kept at extreme larval densities for many generations also show responses to urea: those kept at high larval densities appear to be most resistant to urea. However, these populations show no differences in adult longevity. An additional five populations were selected directly for urea resistance by adding this compound to the larval food environment. Again, there was a strong response to this artificial selection, with urea resistance increasing dramatically, but these populations showed no response in adult longevity or resistance to crowding when compared to five control populations. There is clearly no simple relationship between longevity and larval urea resistance. It may be that age-specific and density-dependent selection induce similar changes in this phenotype, but do so through different genetic and physiological pathways. We suggest that these data are not consistent with the view of constant and symmetric genetic variance-covariance matrices. These data support a more prominent role for observations of evolutionary trajectories rather than static measurements of genetic components of variance.}

      \field{abstract}{The selective pressures leading to the evolution of Sexual Size Dimorphism (SSD) have been well studied in many organisms, yet, the underlying developmental mechanisms are poorly understood. By generating a complete growth profile by sex in Drosophila melanogaster, we describe the sex-specific pattern of growth responsible for SSD. Growth rate and critical size for pupariation significantly contributed to adult SSD, whereas duration of growth did not. Surprisingly, SSD at peak larval mass was twice that of the uneclosed adult SSD with weight loss between peak larval mass and pupariation playing an important role in generating the final SSD. Our finding that weight loss is an important regulator of SSD adds additional complexity to our understanding of how body size is regulated in different sexes. Collectively, these data allow for the elucidation of the molecular-genetic mechanisms that generate SSD, an important component of understanding how SSD evolves.}

      \field{abstract}{The dynamics of stage-structured populations facing stage-specific variability in resource availability and/or demographic factors like unequal sex-ratios, remains poorly understood. We addressed these issues using a stage-structured individual-based model that incorporates life-history parameters common to many holometabolous insects. The model was calibrated using time series data from a 49-generation experiment on laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster, subjected to four different combinations of larval and adult nutritional levels. The model was able to capture multiple qualitative and quantitative aspects of the empirical time series across three independent studies. We then simulated the model to explore the interaction of various life-history parameters and nutritional levels in determining population stability. In all nutritional regimes, constancy stability of the populations was reduced upon increasing egg-hatchability, critical mass, and proportion of body resource allocated to female fecundity. However, the effects of increasing sensitivity of female-fecundity to adult density on constancy stability varied across nutrition regimes. The effects of unequal sex-ratio and sex-specific culling were greatly influenced by fecundity but not by levels of juvenile nutrition. Finally, we investigated the implications of some of these insights on the efficiency of the widely-used pest control method, the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT). We show that increasing the amount of juvenile food had no effects on SIT efficiency when the density-independent fecundity is low, but reduces SIT efficiency when the density-independent fecundity is high.}
