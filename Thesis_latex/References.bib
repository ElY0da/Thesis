  abstract = {Recently single crystals of layered SnSe has
created a paramount importance in thermoelectrics owing to their
ultralow lattice thermal conductivity and high thermoelectric figure
of merit (zT). However, nanocrystalline or polycrystalline
SnSe offers a wide range of thermoelectric applications for the
ease of its synthesis and machinability. Here, we demonstrate high
zT of 2.1 at 873 K in two dimensional (2D) nanoplates of Ge
doped SnSe synthesized by a simple hydrothermal route followed
by spark plasma sintering (SPS). Anisotropic measurements also
show a high zT of \textasciitilde{}1.8 at 873 K parallel to the SPS pressing direction.
3 mol\% Ge-doping in SnSe nanoplates significantly enhances
the p-type carrier concentration which results in high electrical
conductivity and power factor of \textasciitilde{}5.10 {$\mu$}W/cmK2 at 873 K.
In addition to nanoscale grain boundary and high lattice anharmonicity
in SnSe nanoplates, phonon scattering due to Ge precipitates
in the SnSe matrix gives rise to the ultralow lattice thermal
conductivity of \textasciitilde{}0.18 W/mK at 873 K.},
