\chapter{Interplay between Larval Trait Parameters}
In the larval stage model, trait parameters used are initial feeding rate, efficiency, critical size and waste tolerance. These parameters can not be measured directly via experimental approaches, but their effects on other larval traits such as body size, feeding rate at the third instar, development time can be measured easily. Here, I explore how larval trait parameters interact with each other and affect body size, time to reach critical size, feeding rate at critical size and survivorship. Since feeding rate in the model stays constant after reaching critical size, it can be taken as proxy for feeding rate at the third instar stage. Also, time to reach critical size is taken as a proxy for development time since time period between critical size and pupation is taken as a constant in all densities (ref). Larval stage is simulated to obtain body size, development time, final feeding rate (at critical size) and survivorship in MB, MCU and CCU cultures for each combination of initial feeding rate, efficiency and critical size from respective range of mean trait values. Here, effect of waste tolerance is ignored since no significant effect was observed on the body size, development time, final feeding rate and survivorship. Using experimental data and these simualtion results, best combination of trait values are obtained which represents ancestral trait values for each population. Traits measured using these trait values represent MB flies from the experimental data and these trait values are used in further simulations.

\section{Initial Feeding Rate and Efficiency}
All simulation results show that the larval body size, development time, final feeding rate and survivorship are dependent on the larval density. In MCU and CCU culture, overall body size and survivorship are lesser while development time and final feeding rate are always higher for the same range of trait values than in MB culture (see fig~\ref{fig:fr_eff_bs} - fig~\ref{fig:mc_eff_frt}). The larval body size is positively correlated with both initial feeding rate and efficiency at low density (MB culture), while at high densities (MCU and CCU cultures) it is positively correlated only with efficiency (see fig~\ref{fig:fr_eff_bs}). In MCU culture, body size is not affected by the initial feeding rate unlike in CCU culture where initial feeding rate gives lesser body size. Fig~\ref{fig:fr_eff_dt} shows a negative correlation of development time i.e. time to reach critical size with both inital feeding rate and efficiency at all larval densities. survivorship is logistically dependent on efficiency only in MCU and CCU cultures (see fig~\ref{fig:fr_eff_sur}). In MCU culture, survivorship does not show any dependence on inital feeding rate, but in CCU culture it shows a slight negative correlation with initial feeding rate. At all larval densities, final feeding rate is positively correlated with inital feeding rate and negatively with efficiency (see fig~\ref{fig:fr_eff_frt}). In MCU and CCU culture, final feeding rate show exponential dependence with efficiency which increases more with higher initial feeding rate.

\section{Initial Feeding Rate and Critical Size}
For simualtions varying parameter range of mean trait values of initial feeding rate and critical size, all traits show similar pattern with varying density as seen with previous simulations. The larval body size shows similar correlations with initial feeding rate and critical size in MB and MCU culture as seen in simualtions varying initial feeding rate and efficiency (see fig~\ref{fig:fr_mc_bs}). In CCU culture, body size is negatively correlated with initial feeding rate only for smaller values of critical size, but it is not affected by inital feeding rate at larger critical size values. Fig~\ref{fig:fr_mc_dt} shows a negative correlation of development time with inital feeding rate, but poitive correlation with critical size in all culture vials. survivorship is logistically dependent on critical size only in MCU and CCU culture. In MCU and CCU cultures, survivorship shows a slight negative correlation with initial feeding rate (see fig~\ref{fig:fr_mc_sur}). At all larval densities, final feeding rate is positively correlated with both inital feeding rate and critical size (see fig~\ref{fig:fr_mc_frt}).

\section{Critical Size and Efficiency}
In simualtions varying parameter range of mean trait values of initial feeding rate and critical size, all traits measured show similar pattern with varying density as seen with previous simulations. The larval body size shows similar correlations with critical size and efficiency in MB culture as seen in simualtions varying initial feeding rate and efficiency (see fig~\ref{fig:mc_eff_bs}). In MCU and CCU cultures, body size is positively correlated with critical size only for smaller values of efficiency, but is not affected by critical size at larger efficiency values. Fig~\ref{fig:mc_eff_dt} shows a negative correlation of development time with efficiency, but poitive correlation with critical size at all densities. survivorship is logistically dependent on efficiency only in MCU and CCU culture. In MCU and CCU cultures, survivorship also shows a negative correlation with critical size at lower values of efficiency (see fig~\ref{fig:mc_eff_sur}). At all larval densities, final feeding rate is positively correlated with critical size and negatively with efficiency (see fig~\ref{fig:fr_mc_frt}).
