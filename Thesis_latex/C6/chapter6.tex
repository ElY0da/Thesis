\chapter{Introducing Correlations in Larval Trait Parameters}
One of the interesting results that came out of studies on CU populations showed heritable polymorphism present in feeding rate and waste tolerance of these larvae \citep{borashGeneticPolymorphismMaintained1998}. At high density, early eclosing larvae were faster feeding, less waste tolerant and faster developing, whereas late eclosing larvae were slower feeding, more waste tolerant and slower developing. Presence of such polymorphism most likely emerged from the way in which CU populations were maintained \citep{archanaGeneticArchitectureFitnessrelated2009}. \citet{sarangiEcologicalDetailsMediate2018} found a similar early-late pattern with body size and development time of larvae from MCU, CCU and LCU populations across high densities. It was also suggested that these populations might not show polymorphism with feeding rate and waste tolerance observed in CU populations. In this chapter, I have used the model to capture patterns in larval traits of early-late eclosing larvae across various larval densities. If the model is able to simulate results for mean body size distribution with development time similar to the experimental results, then it can be used to predict other mean larval trait value distributions with development time. \\\\
Larval trait parameters used in the model are considered to be independent of each other while assigning to each individual. This model can be useful to understand the distributions of these trait parameters and other life-history traits with development time after a few generations of selection in each density regime. It can also be used to investigate how early eclosing and late eclosing larvae show differences in trait values at different densities.
\section{Distribution of Laral Traits with Development Time}
Simulations are run using the initial conditions for MB, MCU, CCU and MCU populations given in table~\ref{tab:dist_param} at all four densities (replicates = 10, generation = 50). Results from these simulations are plotted for larval body size, final feeding rate (at critical size), efficiency, initial feeding rate, critical size and efficiency. Similar to previous simulations, time to reach critical size is taken as a proxy for development time (see fig~\ref{fig:lh_mb_culture} - \ref{fig:lh_lcu_culture}). For each of the above traits, a scatter plot for mean trait value with development time is plotted (‘x.estimator’ method in ‘seaborn’ by \citet{michael_waskom_2017_883859}, is used to plot mean trait values for each time point). These plots give a clear visualization of mean trait value distribution with development time. Mean trait values towards the right side of the x-axis represent late eclosing flies, whereas such values towards the left side of x-axis represent early eclosing flies.\\\\
In these plots, MB larvae take more to reach critical size compared to MCU, CCU and LCU larvae due to higher critical size, lesser efficiency and initial feeding rate. In MB culture (60 eggs / 6 ml), There is no pattern of body size, efficiency, initial feeding rate and waste tolerance with development time. Since the critical size is higher for larvae with higher development time, final feeding rate is also higher in them across all populations (see fig~\ref{fig:lh_mb_culture}). \\\\
In MCU culture (600 eggs / 1.5 ml), results are similar to mean trait value distributions in MB culture except, decrease in mean body size of late eclosing ones in MCU population. Variation in mean body size is higher for both early and late-developing larvae for all populations in this culture (see fig~\ref{fig:lh_mcu_culture}). \\\\
In CCU culture (1200 eggs / 3 ml), mean body size and efficiency stays constant across development time, but the variation is very less for late developing larvae. Initial feeding rate is slightly higher with a reduced variation for larvae with higher development time. Waste tolerance is higher with a decrease in variation for late developing larvae (see fig~\ref{fig:lh_ccu_culture}). \\\\
In LCU culture (1200 eggs / 6 ml), mean trait values are similar to those in CCU culture except, mean body size, which shows that late-developing larvae have similar body size as early-developing ones. These distributions form a U-shaped curve of mean trait values. For late-developing larvae in this culture, initial feeding rate is also lower, and variation in efficiency is higher across all populations. Mean waste tolerance distribution show late-developing larvae have higher waste tolerance which is more prominent in MCU and LCU populations (see fig~\ref{fig:lh_lcu_culture}).

\section{Negative Correlation between Feeding Rate and Efficiency}
From the mean trait distribution results, the effect of mean initial feeding rate distribution on body size distribution is clear (fig~\ref{fig:lh_ccu_culture} and fig~\ref{fig:lh_lcu_culture}). According to the results mentioned above it is clear that if initial feeding rate is negatively correlated with development time, then the model would give a U-shaped body size distribution found in the empirical data of larval crowded populations \citep{sarangiEcologicalDetailsMediate2018}. Based on the model of \citep{muellerModelEvolutionLarval2015}, a negative correlation between initial feeding rate and efficiency in the model is introduced to understand how these correlations between larval competitive traits would affect other life-history traits. Here, efficiency to convert food into biomass is no longer a heritable trait in the model. Modifications were made such that efficiency is derived at each generation from the distribution of initial feeding rate. The relation between efficiency and intial feeding rate is given as:
\[\epsilon_{i} = K_{\epsilon} - x_{6}*fr_{i}\]
Here,
$\epsilon_{i}$: efficiency of $i^{th}$ larva;\\
$fr_{i}$: initial feeding rate of $i^{th}$ larva;\\
$x_{6}$: scaling parameter;\\
$K_{\epsilon}$: Maximum value of efficiency (constant).\\\\
Using this correlation, timeseries was run for initial conditions given in table~\ref{tab:food_param} and the similar simulations as mentioned in the previous section were performed (replicates = 5). The results show a negative correlation of initial feeding rate across all populations at all four densities (see fig~\ref{fig:neg_corr_frc}). Due to the forced negative correlation between initial feeding rate and efficiency, the mean efficiency distribution shows that late-developing ones have higher efficiency (see fig~\ref{fig:neg_corr_eff}). Fig~\ref{fig:neg_corr_frt} shows that final feeding rate is higher for late developing larvae even if there efficiency is higher and initial feeding rate is lower across all populations at all densities. Fig~\ref{fig:neg_corr_bs} was plotted with higher replicates (n=15) to obtain a clear visualization. Here MCU, CCU and LCU population have mean body size first decreasing then increasing along with all-time decreasing variation with respect to development time in MB and CCU culture. Such patterns are not evident in MB and LCU culture.
